## scrape slack 
To pull your organization's Slack message history:

1. Create a [Slack App](https://api.slack.com/apps) with the following permissions:

![a list of necessary permissions: channels:history, channels:read, channels:write, groups:history, groups:write, im:write, mpim:write, users.profile:read, users: read](./docs/permission-list.png)

2. Prepare your development environment (assumes you have Docker installed on a Mac**):
```
brew bundle 
kar build && kar run bash
```

3. Scrape the messages from a channel, using the token for your Slack App:
```
python scrape_slack.py -t <token> -c <channel> -d <days>
```

** If you're not on a Mac or would prefer not to install Docker, you can install the requirements on your own machine: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
