## scrape slack 
To pull your organization's Slack message history:

1. Create a [Slack App](https://api.slack.com/apps) with the following permissions:
    * channels:history
    * channels:read
    * channels:write
    * groups:history
    * groups:write
    * im:write
    * mpim:write
    * users.profile:read
    * users: read 

2. Prepare your development environment (assumes you have Docker installed on a Mac**):
```
brew bundle 
kar build && kar run bash
```

3. Scrape the messages from a channel, using the token for your Slack App:
```
python scrape_slack.py -t <token> -c <channel> -d <days>
```

** If you're not on a Mac or would prefer not to install Docker, you can install the requirements on your own machine: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## analyze the data
Once you've pulled the Slack message data, you can upload the data in this [Python notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tngzng/slack-audit/blob/main/slack_message_analysis.ipynb), along with your own diversity data. After setting a few constants, you'll be able to visualize breakdowns in total messages and messages over time.
